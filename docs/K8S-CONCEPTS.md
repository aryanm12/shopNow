# 🌱 Kubernetes Concepts for Beginners

Essential Kubernetes concepts explained through the ShopNow application.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

### What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is like a **smart orchestrator** for containers. Think of it as:
- **Container Manager**: Runs and manages your application containers
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across multiple instances
- **Self-Healing System**: Restarts failed containers automatically
- **Resource Scheduler**: Decides where to run containers based on available resources

### Key Components Explained

#### 1. **Cluster** 🏢
Your Kubernetes "data center" - a group of machines working together
```bash
# See your cluster info
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes
```

#### 2. **Namespace** 📁
Like folders for organizing your applications
```bash
# Our ShopNow namespace
kubectl get namespaces
kubectl get pods -n shopnow-demo
```

#### 3. **Pod** 📦
The smallest unit in Kubernetes - usually contains one container and if required other supporting containers
```bash
# See pods in action
kubectl get pods -n shopnow-demo
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n shopnow-demo
```

#### 4. **Deployment** 🚀
Manages multiple copies (replicas) of your application
```bash
# See deployments
kubectl get deployments -n shopnow-demo
kubectl scale deployment backend --replicas=3 -n shopnow-demo
```

#### 5. **Service** 🌐
Provides a stable way to access your pods (like a phone number that never changes)
```bash
# See services
kubectl get services -n shopnow-demo
kubectl describe service backend -n shopnow-demo
```

It helps in Service Discovery within Kubernetes cluster and exposing applications to the external world


#### 6. **ConfigMap** ⚙️
Stores configuration data (like environment variables)
```bash
# See configuration
kubectl get configmaps -n shopnow-demo
kubectl describe configmap backend-config -n shopnow-demo
```

#### 7. **Secret** 🔐
Stores sensitive data (passwords, API keys)
```bash
# See secrets (data is encoded)
kubectl get secrets -n shopnow-demo
kubectl describe secret db-secret -n shopnow-demo
```

#### 8. **Ingress** 🌍
Routes external traffic to your services (like a smart reverse proxy)
```bash
# See ingress rules
kubectl get ingress -n shopnow-demo
kubectl describe ingress shopnow-ingress -n shopnow-demo

# Check ingress controller
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
```
**Why use Ingress?**
- Single entry point for multiple services
- SSL termination and domain-based routing
- Path-based routing (e.g., `/api` → backend, `/admin` → admin app)

#### 9. **Persistent Volume (PV) & Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)** 💾
**PV**: Actual storage resource in the cluster (like a hard drive)
**PVC**: Request for storage by a pod (like asking for space)
```bash
# See storage resources
kubectl get pv,pvc -n shopnow-demo
kubectl describe pvc mongo-pvc -n shopnow-demo
```
**Why separate PV and PVC?**
- **PV**: Cluster admin provisions storage
- **PVC**: Developer requests storage
- **Binding**: Kubernetes matches PVC requests to available PVs

## 🔄 How They Work Together

### ShopNow Application Flow:
1. **Frontend Pod** serves the React customer app
2. **Backend Pod** provides the API
3. **Admin Pod** serves the admin dashboard
4. **MongoDB Pod** stores the data
5. **Services** allow pods to communicate
6. **Ingress** routes external traffic to the right service

```
Internet → Ingress → Services → Pods → Containers
```

## 🤔 Common Beginner Questions

### Q: Why not just use Docker directly?
**A**: Docker runs containers on one machine. Kubernetes runs containers across many machines, with automatic scaling, load balancing, and self-healing.

### Q: What's the difference between a Pod and a Container?
**A**: A container is your application. A pod is Kubernetes' wrapper around one or more containers, providing shared networking and storage.

### Q: Why do I need Services if I have Pods?
**A**: Pods come and go (they're ephemeral). Services provide a stable endpoint that always points to healthy pods.

### Q: When should I use ConfigMaps vs Secrets?
**A**: ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration (API URLs, feature flags). Secrets for sensitive data (passwords, API keys).

## 🛠 Beginner-Friendly Commands

### Essential kubectl Commands
```bash
# Get information
kubectl get pods                    # List pods
kubectl get services               # List services
kubectl get deployments          # List deployments

# Detailed information
kubectl describe pod <name>       # Pod details
kubectl logs <pod-name>          # Pod logs
kubectl logs -f <pod-name>       # Follow logs

# Interactive debugging
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh  # Shell into pod
kubectl port-forward <pod-name> 8080:80 # Access pod locally

# Apply configurations
kubectl apply -f <file.yaml>     # Create/update resources
kubectl delete -f <file.yaml>    # Delete resources
```

### Useful Shortcuts
```bash
# Short forms
kubectl get po    # pods
kubectl get svc   # services
kubectl get deploy # deployments
kubectl get cm    # configmaps

# Watch changes
kubectl get pods -w              # Watch pod changes
kubectl get pods -o wide         # More details
```
